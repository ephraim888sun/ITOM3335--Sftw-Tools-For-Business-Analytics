    "# Variables and Assignment\n",
    "Each cell in a Jupyter Notebook contains a \"snippet\" of code. Once you run the cell, any variables (we'll get to this in a minute) assigned or changed, become part of your program. As we move forward, you will find the same thing holds true for functions, methods, imported modules etc. Each time you make a change, by running a cell, that effects of that change are available when you run future cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first notebook, we experimented with running cells containing numbers. What if we want to capture data and have it available to use with pieces of Python code we want to run in other cells? This is where we introduce the concept of _variables_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a name or label that is used to store data or values. It acts as a placeholder for the data that can be changed or updated during the execution of a program. Variables are created and assigned values using the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code snippet demonstrates the declaration and initialization of a variable named \"x\" with the value of 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, \"x\" is the variable name, and 10 is the value assigned to it. After the assignment, \"x\" can be used throughout the program to refer to the value 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning that they can hold values of different types. The type of a variable is determined based on the value assigned to it. For instance, a variable can hold an integer, a floating-point number, a string, or even more complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also perform operations and calculations with variables, modify their values, and use them in expressions. Python allows variables to be reassigned with new values, so you can easily update the content of a variable throughout the program as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, variables are a fundamental concept in Python and are essential for storing and manipulating data within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, enter the following three lines of code then run the cell (do you remember how to run a cell using the _Run_ button (above) or __SHIFT-Enter__)??.\n",
